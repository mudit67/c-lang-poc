# Chapter 8 - Functions

- Function don't need to be declared before defining them. but if the funtion is defined after main function, the compiler will throw a warning.[Example](../testing/func_dec.c)
- Function which don't have a return type would have a default return type of int, though compiler will show a warning. [Example](../testing/func_return_type.c)
